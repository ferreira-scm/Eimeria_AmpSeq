# Eimeria_AmpSeq

Code, figures and intermediate files for "Eimeria quatification using
amplicom sequencing" manuscript

Start running the code from Lab_6* and/or Wild_8*
Better, yet, we renamed the script so you start at 1_*

Here is how the figures and tables in the manuscript are created in
the code.


| File reference | Created in | File in ropository                   |
|:---------------|------------|:-------------------------------------|
| Figure 1       | R/XXXX     | figures/map_study_overview_multi.png |
| Figure S1      | R/XXXX     | input_data/primer_file_foxes.csv     |
| Table 1        | R/XXXX     | text only                            |
|                |            |                                      |
|                |            |                                      |
|                |            |                                      |


And a short summary of what each script does

## R/1_XXXX.R

Does this and that 

Produces figure X, Table X, 

Creates object XXX for futher use in script R/D_XXX.R

## R/2_XXXX.R

Does this and that 

Produces figure X, Table X, 

Creates object XXX for futher use in script R/D_XXX.R
